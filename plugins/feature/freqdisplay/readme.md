<h1>Frequency Display Plugin</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The Frequency Display plugin displays the center frequency and/or power of a selected channel.
The displayed values are scaled to the size of the window, so can be made large enough to be visible from a distance.
Optionally, the values can be spoken whenever they change, which may be useful when tuning circuits or antennas and the screen isn't visible.

<h2>Interface</h2>

<h3>1: Channel</h3>

Select which TX or RX channel to display the centre frequency or power for.

In order for the power to be able to displayed, the channel must include a value with the channelPowerDB key in its channel report.

<h3>2: Display</h3>

Choose the text to display:

* Frequency - displays the selected channel's (1) centre frequency in Hz.
* Power - displays the selected channel's (1) power in dB.
* Frequency & Power - displays the selected channel's (1) centre frequency in Hz and power in dB.

<h3>3: T - Transparent</h3>

When Transparent mode is checked, only the centre frequency and/or power will be displayed with a transparent background,
so it can be overlaid on other windows.
